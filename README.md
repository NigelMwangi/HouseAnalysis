Data Understanding,-examining the data format and identifying key variables, such as sale prices, property details, and transaction dates. Additionally, we will explore any additional relevant attributes that may influence housing market dynamics.

Data Preparation, involves transforming, cleaning, and organizing raw data to ensure its quality, consistency, and suitability for analysis. The process typically includes several key steps

Modeling;-Using models help us understand the underlying drivers of house prices, identify influential factors, and make informed predictions about future trends
Visualizations;- understand the dispersion of data points around the regression line, and potentially identify any neighborhood-specific pricing patterns. Helping the stakeholders understand much on the models carried out
Also, Regression results- To identify the features and interpret their coefficients in plain language

## Conclusions
